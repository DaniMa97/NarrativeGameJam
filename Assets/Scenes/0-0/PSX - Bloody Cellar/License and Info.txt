PSX Textures - Bloody Cellar
A nightmare sealed away... until now.
The old house was never meant to be explored. At least, that’s what the locals said. The cellar door was nailed shut decades ago, but something down there still breathes.

Now, it’s your turn to bring that nightmare to life.

"Bloody Cellar" is a PSX-style texture pack crafted for indie horror developers who crave the grainy, lo-fi terror of the late ‘90s. With grimy stone walls, raw concrete, rusted metal, and floors stained with something not quite red paint, every asset is designed to make your game feel like a lost, forbidden relic from a haunted PlayStation disc.

This Pack Includes:
✅ Seamless textures in two resolutions: 256x256 and 128x128 

 ✅ All textures in .png format 

 ✅ 20 Base Textures, each with:

4 Bloody Variants (2 unique blood patterns, each in low & high intensity)
2 Texture Styles 
 ✅ Bonus: 5 decals (with more to come!) 

 ✅ Weekly Updates! Expand your horror arsenal with fresh assets every week—at no extra cost!

464 Total Textures for maximum variety, and blending possibilities.
​All textures were created in Substance Designer.
